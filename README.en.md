# DÂ³ Data Wizard for OXID eShop

The module `DataWizard` offers a framework for the simple integration of exports via the admin area of the OXID shop.

The exports are defined via database queries or ready-made data lists. Various export formats are available. The generation is possible at any time and always recurring (within the system limits). These are offered as downloads in the browser.

All exports and tasks are grouped together for better clarity.

Sample exports are included in the package d3/datawizardtasks. These are intended to serve as an implementation reference for individual exports.

## Installation

In the console in the shop root (above source and vendor), execute the following command:

```bash
php composer require d3/datawizard
``` 

Activate the module in the admin area of the shop in "Extensions -> Modules".

## Extensibility

The module represents the technical basic framework of the exports and does not claim to be complete. In order to adapt the scope to individual requirements, the following extensions are prepared:

- Add exports or tasks
- Use existing and new groups
- Add export formats

Independently of this, all extension options are available that the OXID Shop provides for modules.

## Extension packages

- `d3/datawizardtasks` - provides sample exports and their implementation reference
- `d3/datawizardcli` - provides the execution of exports or tasks via the command prompt (e.g. as cronjobs)
- `d3/datawizardlink` - provides URLs to generate exports from third party systems
